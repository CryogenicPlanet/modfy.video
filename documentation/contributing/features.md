# Contributing a Feature

This is a more involved process than adding a codec or format or workflow, but it is because there is far more customization potential

There are three main steps:

1. Create A {@page Feature Class}
2. Create a {@page Feature UI}
3. {@page Adding Your Feature}

# {@page Feature Class}

In summary, in this section you will be creating the child class of {@link FFmpegFeature} which will execute the functionality of your feature.

To achieve this, **you only have to write three functions** everything else is written for you.

# {@page Feature UI}

Here, you will be creating the UI for your feature. Here is where the user will be interacting with your feature. Here

**You don't have to build the UI components yourself**, unless you want to. There are pre-made components for you.

# {@page Adding Your Feature}

Here you simply record the feature you add it so it can be incorporated into the rest of the application

# Pull Request

After these steps you can send us a pull request. As this pull request is likely to have a substantial amount of code, please comment it and document it well.
