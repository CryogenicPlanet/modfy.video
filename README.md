A video transcoder and converter built use Web Assembly and FFMPEG to transcode and convert videos right in your browser while protecting your privacy

**This project is still very early in development and only a proof of concept**

## Contributing 

We would love any/all support from the community, and are depending on it for add support for more codecs and formats. We have another repository just for contributing codecs and formats [here](https://github.com/Mozilla-Open-Lab-Etwas/Video-Transcoder-Codecs-Formats) where we will automatically test your added codecs and add them to production if they pass our tests
